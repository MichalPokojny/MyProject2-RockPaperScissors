tapping on the images gives the same effect.

trips that collect details of potential customers and other requests.
- The following input fields First Name, Last name, Email address, and
Requests are required to successfully send the form.

## Technologies used

- Balsamiq - Wireframe planning.
- HTML5 - Main structure of the website.
- CSS3 - Styling of the website.
- Javascript - Website Interactive Part (description to be edited)
- GitPod - Workspace of the project.
- GitHub - Hosting the website.
- Grammarly - Grammar check of all the text in the website and readme file.
- Google Chrome - Main testing of the website on all devices.
- Google Chrome Lighthouse - Testing the performance of each page.

## Testing


- I tested this webpage on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and on Safari.
- I confirmed that this project is fully responsive, and works on every screen device using the dev tools device toolbar.
- I confirmed that the registration form submits once all required fields have data inputted.

### Bugs

**Solved bugs**

- When I first imported all of the photos I used the highest resolution available. I also made a long path to the source and so the performance of the
page was too slow.
I replaced them with an appropriate resolution for both desktop and mobile
devices which increased the loading speed. 

**Validator testing**

- HTML 
-- No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.
- CSS
-- No errors were found when passing through the official validator.
- Accessibility
-- I confirmed that the images, colours and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through the Google Chrome lighthouse in devtools.
